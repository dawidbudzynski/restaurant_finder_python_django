    'ITALIAN': 'Italian cuisine is generally characterized by its simplicity, with many dishes having only two to '

             'olives, meat, etc.) baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven. In formal '
             'settings, like a restaurant, pizza is eaten with knife and fork, but in casual settings it is cut '

                'dessert wine or liqueur, but may include coffee, cheeses, nuts, or other savory items. '

                'emphasis on grape wine and on sauces as condiments, seasonings, or accompaniments. Many '
                'dairy products are utilised in the cooking process, except in nouvelle cuisine. ',
    'FAST_FOOD': "The fastest form of 'fast food' consists of pre-cooked meals kept in readiness for a "
                 "customer's arrival, "
                 "with waiting time reduced to mere seconds. Other fast food outlets, primarily the hamburger "
                 "outlets use mass-produced pre-prepared ingredients but take great pains to point out to "
                 "the customer that the 'meat and potatoes' are always cooked fresh and assembled 'to order'.",

                   'always eaten with the hands; for example, Ethiopian cuisine is eaten by rolling various '
